## The Owlbear Guild Hall 

Due to Orosteadâ€™s placement on Lake Ils, which rests at the convergence of several notable waterways, it houses a thriving Adventuring Guild. The guild is currently run by So- lace, a retired mage, in the Abjuration Ward. Only the most trustworthy adventurers are accepted into its hallowed halls and carry their symbol, which has helped the Guild thrive on repeat customers over the decades. Many contracts ranging across the land and into neighboring regions begin here, and its guild members are well compensated for their service.
